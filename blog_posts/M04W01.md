**Module Goal:** This module provides a comprehensive overview of two fundamental ensemble learning algorithms, **Random Forest** and **AdaBoost**. We will explore their core principles, practical applications, and how they differ. Additionally, we will cover the essential skill of deploying a machine learning model using **Gradio** and introduce the unique challenges and characteristics of working with **Time Series Data**.


### **1. Random Forest:** 

A deep dive into this bagging-based algorithm, understanding how it leverages multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.

### **2. Gradio for ML Model Deployment:** 

Learn how to quickly and easily build a user interface for your models, allowing for interactive testing and demonstration.

### **3. AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting):** 

An introduction to this boosting algorithm, which iteratively learns from the mistakes of weak learners to construct a robust and powerful model.

### **4. Time Series Data:** 

An initial look at time-dependent data, covering key concepts and its relevance in fields like finance, weather forecasting, and more.
