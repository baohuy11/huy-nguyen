# M04W02: Advanced Machine Learning and Web Deployment

**Module Goal:** This module will explore **advanced machine learning techniques**, specifically focusing on the powerful boosting algorithm **Gradient Boosting** and its highly optimized variant, **XGBoost**. We will also learn how to practically apply our knowledge by deploying a machine learning model to the web and, finally, apply all of our skills to a comprehensive **Time Series Data Project**.


## Key Topics

1. **Gradient Boosting:** Dive into this powerful boosting technique that builds a model sequentially, with each new model correcting the errors of the previous ones.

2.  **Web Deployment:** Learn the essential skills needed to take a machine learning model from a local environment and deploy it to the web for public use or demonstration.

3.  **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting):** Explore this highly efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting. We'll examine why XGBoost has become a go-to tool in data science competitions and industry.

4.  **Time Series Data Project:** Apply the knowledge gained in this and previous modules to a real-world project involving time series data, reinforcing key concepts and practical application.
